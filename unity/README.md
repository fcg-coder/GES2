![Game Start Screen](screenshot.png)

An example of how to run a Unity WebGL game using Docker.
Although not the most exciting game, it could prove useful to be able to build and share games using Docker.

#### Run the game:

`docker-compose up -d`

Then visit **localhost:8080** in a Browser.

### Stop the game:

`docker-compose down`
